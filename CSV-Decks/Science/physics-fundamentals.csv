What is Newton's First Law?,An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force
What is Newton's Second Law?,F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration)
What is Newton's Third Law?,For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
What is the speed of light in a vacuum?,299,792,458 m/s (approximately 3×10⁸ m/s)
What is gravity on Earth?,9.8 m/s² (acceleration due to gravity)
What is kinetic energy?,KE = ½mv² (energy of motion)
What is potential energy?,PE = mgh (energy due to position)
What is Ohm's Law?,V = IR (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
What is power in electrical terms?,P = VI (Power = Voltage × Current)
What is the law of conservation of energy?,Energy cannot be created or destroyed only transformed
What is frequency?,Number of cycles per second measured in Hertz (Hz)
What is wavelength?,Distance between two consecutive peaks of a wave
What is the relationship between frequency and wavelength?,c = fλ (speed of light = frequency × wavelength)
What is absolute zero?,-273.15°C or 0 Kelvin
What is the ideal gas law?,PV = nRT
What is density?,ρ = m/V (mass per unit volume)
What is momentum?,p = mv (mass times velocity)
What is impulse?,J = FΔt = Δp (force times time = change in momentum)
What is work in physics?,W = Fd (force times distance)
What is efficiency?,η = useful output/total input × 100%
