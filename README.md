## üìã CSV File Format

Create study decks using standard CSV files with two columns:

```csv
cue,answer
What is the capital of France?,Paris
2 + 2 = ?,4
Bonjour,Hello
```

### Supported Column Names

The parser automatically recognizes these column headers:

**For Questions/Cues:**
- `cue`, `question`, `front`, `q`, `prompt`

**For Answers:**
- `answer`, `back`, `a`, `response`, `resp`

**No headers?** No problem! The first two columns will be used as cue and answer.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Space** | Reveal/hide answer |
| **Enter** | Skip to next due card |
| **1** | Grade: Again (failed - start over) |
| **2** | Grade: Hard (difficult recall) |
| **3** | Grade: Good (normal recall) |
| **4** | Grade: Easy (effortless recall) |
| **s** | Suspend/unsuspend current card |

## üß† How Spaced Repetition Works

The application uses a modified **SM-2 algorithm** that adjusts review intervals based on your performance:

### Grading System
- **Grade 1 (Again)**: Complete failure ‚Üí Reset progress, review soon
- **Grade 2 (Hard)**: Difficult recall ‚Üí Shorter interval, reduced ease
- **Grade 3 (Good)**: Normal recall ‚Üí Standard interval progression
- **Grade 4 (Easy)**: Effortless recall ‚Üí Longer interval, increased ease

### Reverse Mode
- **Bidirectional Study**: Toggle "Reverse cards" to show answers first and test recall of questions
- **Same Statistics**: Card progress remains unchanged when switching directions - both forward and reverse test the same memory association
- **Perfect for Languages**: Test "Bonjour ‚Üí Hello" and "Hello ‚Üí Bonjour" using the same card data

### Scheduling Logic
1. **First review**: 1 day (or 1 minute in fast mode)
2. **Second review**: 6 days (or 6 minutes in fast mode)
3. **Subsequent reviews**: Previous interval √ó ease factor

### Ease Factor
- Starts at 2.5 for new cards
- Increases with easy grades (max ~3.0)
- Decreases with difficult grades (min 1.3)
- Determines how quickly intervals grow

## üìä Study Modes

### Review Due
- Shows only cards that are currently due for review
- Optimal for regular study sessions
- Follows spaced repetition timing

### Cram All
- Shows all cards regardless of due time
- Useful for intensive review sessions
- Ignores spaced repetition scheduling

## üíæ Data Management & Progress Tracking

### How Progress Tracking Works

The application automatically tracks your learning progress across all study sessions using a sophisticated local storage system:

#### **Deck Identification**
- Each CSV file gets a unique identifier (hash) based on its content
- Hash format: `tinySRS:a1b2c3d4` (first 6 characters shown in UI)
- Same CSV content = same deck ID, preserving progress
- Modified CSV content = new deck ID, fresh start

#### **Card-Level Data Tracking**
Each flashcard stores comprehensive study statistics:

```javascript
{
  id: 0,                    // Sequential card number
  cue: "Bonjour",          // Question/prompt text
  answer: "Hello",         // Correct answer
  n: 3,                    // Number of successful reviews
  ef: 2.8,                 // Ease factor (1.3 to ~3.0)
  ivl: 172800000,          // Next interval in milliseconds
  due: 1695123456789,      // Due time (timestamp)
  lapses: 1,               // Times you got it wrong
  suspended: false         // Whether card is disabled
}
```

#### **Session Persistence**
- **Automatic saves** after every card grading
- **Instant updates** to browser localStorage
- **No manual save required** - everything is automatic
- **Works offline** - no internet connection needed

### Storage Location & Technical Details

#### **Browser localStorage**
- **Location**: Your browser's local storage database
- **Namespace**: Keys prefixed with `tinySRS:`
- **Capacity**: Typically 5-10MB per domain
- **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts, computer reboots
- **Scope**: Domain-specific (only this HTML file can access)

#### **Storage Structure**
```
localStorage['tinySRS:a1b2c3'] = {
  "name": "french_vocabulary_500.csv",
  "cards": [
    { /* card 1 data */ },
    { /* card 2 data */ },
    // ... all cards with progress
  ]
}
```

#### **Cross-Session Behavior**
1. **First Load**: New deck creates fresh cards with default values
2. **Subsequent Loads**: Existing progress merged with CSV data
3. **Card Matching**: Uses `cue + answer` combination as unique key
4. **Data Merging**: New cards added, existing cards preserve progress
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: Only cards present in CSV are kept

### Progress Preservation Scenarios

#### **‚úÖ Progress WILL Be Saved:**
- Closing and reopening the HTML file
- Browser restart
- Computer restart
- Loading same CSV file multiple times
- Switching between different decks

#### **‚ùå Progress WILL Be Lost:**
- Using browser's private/incognito mode
- Clearing browser data/localStorage
- Using different browser or device
- Moving HTML file to different domain/location

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Progress MIGHT Be Lost:**
- Browser storage quota exceeded
- Browser automatic cleanup (rare)
- System crashes during save operation

### Export & Backup Options

#### **Automatic Export**
Click "Export progress" to download complete study data:

```json
{
  "name": "french_vocabulary_500.csv",
  "key": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "exported": "2025-09-19T10:30:00.000Z",
  "cards": [
    {
      "cue": "Bonjour",
      "answer": "Hello", 
      "n": 3,
      "ef": 2.8,
      "ivl": 172800000,
      "due": 1695123456789,
      "lapses": 1,
      "suspended": false
    }
    // ... all cards with complete statistics
  ]
}
```

#### **Manual Backup Strategy**
1. **Regular exports**: Download JSON files periodically
2. **Multiple locations**: Store backups in different folders
3. **Version control**: Date your backup files
4. **Cloud sync**: Put backups in Dropbox/Google Drive/etc.

### Data Recovery & Migration

#### **Moving Between Devices**
Since localStorage is browser-specific, to transfer progress:
1. Export progress from original device
2. Copy HTML file to new device
3. Load CSV deck on new device
4. Manually import progress (requires custom modification)

#### **Browser Changes**
- **Same browser, same device**: Progress preserved
- **Different browser**: Must export/import progress
- **Browser profile reset**: Progress lost unless exported

### Reset Progress
- "Reset ease" button clears all progress data
- Returns all cards to initial state (n=0, ef=2.5, due=now)
- **Cannot be undone** - export first if you want backup!
- Useful for starting fresh or fixing corrupted data

### Privacy & Security Implications

#### **What's Stored Locally:**
- Your study progress and statistics
- Card content (questions and answers)
- Review history and timing data
- Settings preferences

#### **What's NOT Stored:**
- Personal identifying information
- Study session times/durations
- Device or browser information
- Any data on external servers

#### **Data Access:**
- Only this HTML file can read the data
- Other websites cannot access your progress
- Data stays on your device unless you export it
- No telemetry or analytics collection
